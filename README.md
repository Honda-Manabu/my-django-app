# My Django App
## **Background of theme selection**
Having just retired from a 40-year career as a corporate employee, I found myself living every day like a Sunday, eager to do something I hadn't been able to do before. Also, trying new things can help with anti-aging. I decided to become a web designer, but nine years later, my MySite is still under construction.

I started this introductory course in the summer of 2021, which current students would complete in one semester. I haven't stopped. With the help of Duck AI, I managed to reach the Final Project. It would have been so much better if I had focused on this account from the beginning. Creating a web page involved learning a vast amount of knowledge that I wasn't sure would ever be useful, struggling, and then ultimately discarding it all. I've even forgotten the names of the development environment and page creation software my first teacher recommended. Three years later, I decided to use Linux and WordPress on AWS Lightsail, but at the time, just creating the instance and setting it up took countless hours. Now, most of the process is automated and can be completed in minutes. When it came time to work with the database, I suddenly couldn't log in to the admin board. I was bogged down in a loop between AWS, Bitnami, and WordPress, and paid support was no help at all, which was frustrating. Just when I was starting to have doubts about navigating the WordPress maze, where the latest specifications coexist with legacy relics, I finally submitted my first sensible work for the Homepage assignment in CS50X, which covered Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and (Flask is not available) in a short period of time that made me wonder what all those years had been.

After eight years of research and research, where new things replaced the actual work and I had barely accumulated any useful knowledge, I decided to start again with a new approach.
## **Project Objectives**
### **To earn a certificate of completion for "CS50's Introduction to Computer Science."**
### **It also marks the culmination of nine years of struggling with web-related software.**

The project I'm sharing here was decided after numerous questions to ChatGPT. However, since starting this project, I've realized that the wonderful world of open source software can be very difficult for beginners, with so many different versions and approaches. For example, the official documentation for setting up Apache web server software on an AWS Bitnami-Django instance is often difficult to understand and extremely incomplete. It's impossible to complete without the help of generative AI. So, by recording my detours and what works well in this project, I hope to inspire freeware developers to automate their own projects.
